# Solar System 2.0

## What changed?

### In order to have an improved version I added an orbit control.
Now the user can:
- Zoom.
- Change the center point.
- Change the point of view.

### Second imporvement.
I added a side menu whit a list of all of the planets. By clicking a button, you can get some informations about the planet. 

P.S. Don't expect too much details, this is not an official page after all.
